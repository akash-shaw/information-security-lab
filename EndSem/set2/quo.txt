Design and implement a privacy-preserving medical records management system with the following requirements:

System Architecture: Create a client-server architecture where:

Doctors (clients) can register, submit medical reports, and log expenses
An auditor can verify reports and perform aggregate analysis without decrypting individual records
Cryptographic Requirements:

Use RSA for encrypting sensitive AES keys during report transmission
Use ElGamal for digitally signing reports with timestamps
Use Paillier homomorphic encryption for department information to enable privacy-preserving keyword searches
Use RSA-based homomorphic encryption to allow summation of encrypted expenses without decryption
Use AES-256 for authenticated encryption of report contents
Functional Features:

Doctor registration with encrypted department information
Secure report submission with signature verification
Privacy-preserving expense tracking where individual amounts remain encrypted
Auditor capabilities to:
Search doctors by department keyword without decrypting data
Sum all expenses across doctors or per-doctor while maintaining encryption
Verify report authenticity and timestamps
List and audit all stored records
Implementation Details:

Implement server-side state management with persistent JSON storage
Implement client-side key generation and cryptographic operations
Use socket-based TCP communication with JSON serialization
Handle concurrent connections with thread-safe operations
Support multiple independent doctor clients connecting to a single server
Required: Provide both server and client implementations with proper key management, error handling, and an interactive menu system for all user roles.
